 The function of the system is to detect fake news and guide users on the relevance of the news. The system is a tool for users where they can search different trending news, forwarded messages through social media or any other platform and check the authenticity of the news and decide whether or not the searched topic is fake or factual.           When user finds a news on any of the social media platforms, the user would copy the text of news and use it as an Input or query for our system. Based on the document collection we have, we will retrieve all the relevant documents and indicate how much authenticity is present in the news.
